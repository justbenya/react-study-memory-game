## Game rules
At the beginning of the game, all the cards are mixed up and laid in rows, face down on the table.
Player starts and turns over two cards:
- If the cards don’t match (it’s not a pair), he turns them back over.
- However, if the two cards match, it’s a pair! He keeps the cards and has the right to play again.

When the player have found all the pairs, the game is over.
